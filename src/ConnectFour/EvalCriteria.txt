Position Evaluation Criteria:

Currently Implemented:
    - Total Possible 4s
        - Scoring
            - Each player has a score out of 69 possible ways to win the game
            - There are 3 possible vertical 4s in each of 7 columns - Total of 21
            - There are 4 possible horizontal 4s in each of 6 rows - Total of 24
            - There are 12 possible diagonals in each direction - Total of 24
        - We find how many of these are available for each player after a move is made
        - Evaluation is done based on who has the most possible ways to win
    - Weighted checks in possible 4s
        - Some of the possible 4s already contain some pieces
        - For each possible 4, if there is already 1, 2, or 3 pieces in it, it is weighted more heavily

Position Evaluation Criteria:

Currently Implemented:
    - Total Possible 4s
        - Scoring
            - Each player has a score out of 69 possible ways to win the game
            - There are 3 possible vertical 4s in each column of 6 - Total of 24
            - There are 4 possible horizontal 4s in each row of 7 - Total of 21
            - There are 12 possible diagonals in each direction - Total of 24
        - We find how many of these are available for each player after a move is made
        - Evaluation is done based on who has the most possible ways to win

Implementation Plan:
    - Weighted possible 4s
        - Each way of making 4 is weighted differently based on if there are already pieces played for that player
        - Weight will also vary based on the current player's turn
            - If a player has 3/4 in a row but the opponent just played, they have an automatic win
    - Recursive checks
        - Recursively evaluate positions to a certain depth to find more clearly if a certain player has an advantage
        - Takes into account who has the next move
